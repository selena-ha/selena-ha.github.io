                    <p>The increase of medical and healthcare apps and platforms, while offering diverse benefits, can create confusion and challenges for individuals trying to stay on top of their health demands. MedPak will provide users the confidence to stay on top of their health and wellness information. Users will have access to medical documents, manage appointments and learn more about health and wellness information.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>In response to the recent pandemic, online medical services were accepted quickly as in-person visits were limited. It has reshaped the way healthcare is delivered and accessed by individuals. To take a look at how the online medical services are employed, I did a competitive analysis to identify the things that are going well and any pain points users are experiencing.</p>

            <h3>User Surveys and User Interviews</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:3vh">I conducted a survey and an interview to better understand user’s health and wellbeing goals, what tools they are using to track their goals and how they store their current medical files. The survey consisted of 15 questions and gathered 10 responses. The interview included 12 questions with 5 participants.</p>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>With the mid-fidelity prototypes, I conducted a moderated remote and in-person usability test. Six test participants were recruited from my personal network to understand any difficulties the user may have when navigating to their goal. In each session, the participants are given a set of scenarios and asked to complete the desired task.</p>

                <li>Measure how users would find a doctor.</li>
                <li>Can participants book an appointment with the chosen doctor?</li>
                <li>How will the participants access resources and articles? </li>
                </ol>
        </div>
        <h3 style="padding-top:1em">Usability Testing Analysis</h3>
        <p>After organizing the data from the usability testing, I extracted and grouped information collaboratively using four groups: Observations, Positive Quotes, Negative Quotes and Errors. Then I used a Rainbow Spreadsheet to visualize unseen patterns and hierarchies that had emerge. I was able to pinpoint the key problems that users were having and looked into possible solutions.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 8vh;">My next step would be to design for tablets and desktop, creating a responsive web app.
                I would work on another feature to add to the app, which would be to have multiple profiles under one account for users who care for family members.
                I would conudct user research with health professionals to learn from their side, how the app can better the communication between patients and professionals.</p>
